Geospatial Analysis of Student Mobility and Classroom Utilization

Overview:
This project analyzes student movement patterns and classroom utilization at Indiana University Bloomington using geospatial visualizations. The goal is to assist students in identifying optimal study/dining locations and help university administrators optimize classroom allocations based on real-time and historical data.

Features:
1) Sankey Diagram: Shows student flow from classrooms to dining/study locations (Plotly in Python).
2) Geospatial Heatmap: Displays student density across campus with a time slider (Folium in Python).

Repository Contents:
1) Luddy_course_Trends.csv - Synthetically generated dataset containing class locations, capacities, and student movement patterns.
2) Sankey_diagram_and_Heatmap.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook for generating the Sankey diagram and geospatial heatmap.
3) README.md - Documentation for the project.

Data Source
1) Indiana University Bloomington Learning Spaces Database: https://learningspaces.iu.edu/classroom-tech/classroom-database.html
2) Synthetic data: Generated using ChatGPT-4o.
